# About
Python module that contains a cycleGAN, U-Net CycleGAN, Fixed-Point GAN and color transfer implementation in Tensorflow 2.
As U-Net cycleGANs and Fixed-Point GANs are based on cycleGANs most util functions are defined within "cyclegan/util".
Each deeplearning-based approach is encapsulated in a class with the functions "train", "validate" and "evaluate".
For usage, please refer to the "scripts" folder for examples.
